## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! Iâ€™m Anicha from SAYNA, a digital school focused on learning digital jobs with a supportive community and a fun approach.

Iâ€™m interested in coding, though Iâ€™m not a developer myself.
Right now, Iâ€™m diving into development and learning how to master it.
Iâ€™m eager to collaborate on various projects to understand different development methodologies globally. Wish me luck!
You can reach me at: anichasan123@gmail.com

Iâ€™m excited about this learning journey and look forward to connecting with others who share the same passion for development. Together, we can explore new methodologies and grow in this dynamic field. Thank you for your support and interest!
